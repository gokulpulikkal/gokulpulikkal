## Hi there 👋

I'm a Mobile App Developer with over 4 years of expertise in iOS, tvOS, and Roku platforms. I excel in crafting innovative and user-friendly apps, leveraging the latest industry technologies and trends to deliver high-quality, engaging experiences for clients and users.

## My latest projects 👨‍💻
- I'm currently working on a full project to learn swiftUI and new features Apple has just released. This project is to make an intuitive and visually appealing minimalistic expense tracker app to help users manage and analyze their spending habits.

- Another project I'm working on is a clipboard client for the macOS menu bar. The app will have versions for iOS and iPadOS to provide seamless access to copied content across devices, as long as all devices share the same Apple ID. You can check out the project [here](https://github.com/gokulpulikkal/ClipBoardClientMac)
