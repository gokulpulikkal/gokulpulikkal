I'm a Mobile App Developer with over 4 years of expertise in iOS, tvOS, and Roku platforms. I excel in crafting innovative and user-friendly apps, leveraging the latest industry technologies and trends to deliver high-quality, engaging experiences for clients and users.

## My latest project 👨‍💻
I'm currently working on a full project to learn swiftUI and new features Apple has just released. This project is to make an intuitive and visually appealing minimalistic expense tracker app to help users manage and analyze their spending habits.
